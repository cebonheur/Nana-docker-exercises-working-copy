Exercise 3

i. Confirm if MySQL and phpMyAdmin will still communicate if I don't explicitly specify expose a port on MySQL container in docker compose.

ii. I made some changes to the yaml file to rename the mysql database and image name or so i think and the phpmyadmin stopped connecting. I think it is related to the PMA_HOST env variale. Investigate this further.
